# Web Scraping with Python and Pandas (Jupyter Notebook)

## 📋 Project Overview

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to scrape data from a real website using Python's BeautifulSoup and requests libraries. The extracted data is cleaned and structured using pandas, and then stored in a DataFrame for further analysis or export.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing

- Requests for accessing webpage content

- Pandas for structuring and manipulating tabular data

## 🔍 Key Features

- Scrapes HTML table data from a live webpage

- Parses rows and columns using BeautifulSoup

- Cleans and structures raw text into a pandas DataFrame

- Handles whitespace and text formatting using .strip()

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to locate and extract HTML elements with find_all()

- How to loop through HTML rows and create clean records

- How to append and manage scraped data efficiently in pandas
